                In our age of virtual existences and on-line experiences the digital skills and confidence of young children using a tablet, laptop or smart phone is truly impressive...but you'll be truly shocked if you question them about where their food comes from.

                <h3>In a recent food survey of 2,000 children</h3>
                Sustainable food and farming organisation Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>28% didn't know that carrots grow underground. </li>
                    <li>60% admitted they didn't know lettuce grew on the ground </li>
                    <li>78% didn't know broccoli grew on a plant</li>
                    <li>5% believe strawberries grow inside the fridge</li>
                </ul>
                <p> How can we develop our children's awareness of the benefits of fresh food using their digital knowledge? </p>
                <p >Using a seamless interaction between software and hardware. The TableFarm gameplay makes use of many real-time sensors and plant care opportunities. Chidren will be rewarded in game for their plant progress.</p>
