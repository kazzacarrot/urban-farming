                <p>The smart plant growing device for children... in the home or classroom.</p>
                <p>Using a wonderfully immersive gamified growing experience the TableFarm allows interaction with the the growing platform via smartphone, laptop or tablet.</p>
                <p>
                In our age of virtual existences and on-line experiences the digital skills and confidence of young children using a tablet, laptop or smart phone is truly impressive...but you\'ll be truly shocked if you question them about where their food comes from.

                <ul>
                    <li><font color="#FF9933">28%</font> didn\'t know that carrots grow underground. </li>
                    <li><font color="#FF9933">60%</font> admitted they didn\'t know lettuce grew on the ground </li>
                    <li><font color="#FF9933">78%</font> didn\'t know broccoli grew on a plant</li>
                    <li><font color="#FF9933">5%</font> believe strawberries grow inside the fridge</li>
                </ul>
                <p> How can we develop our children\'s awareness of the benefits of fresh food using their digital knowledge? </p>
                <p >Using a seamless interaction between software and hardware. The TableFarm gameplay makes use of many real-time sensors and plant care opportunities. Chidren will be rewarded in game for their plant progress.</p>
