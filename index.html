            <font color="#FF9933"><h2>What?</h2></font>
            <p>TableFarm is a fully integrated physical plant growing incubator for children utilising digital technology to gamify the process of growing. It bridges the digital-physical divide as an internet-of-things plant growing incubator using  an accompanying software/app platform designed for social media integration and remote operation. 
            Conceived as a Tamagotchi-like device for real living plants, it uses an interactive gamified growing experience via smart phone, laptop or electronic tablet - enabling the cultivation of edible plants within the home and classroom.</p>

            <p>
            In our age of virtual existences and on-line experiences the digital skills and confidence of young children using a tablet, laptop or smart phone is truly impressive...but you'll be truly shocked if you question them about where their food comes from.
